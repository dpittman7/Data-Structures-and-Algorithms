The major impact of the function that influences the time complexity is the size of the List.
The for loop iterates for half of the size of the value. 
A function that expresses the runtime is f(n) = (10n)/2, whereas n is the size of the linked list.
With polynomial expressions, the highest power term dictates the function that is Big O to it. 
Therefore, the reverse function is O(n). The expression is Big O to linear time.

The remove_if function is Big-O to O(n). The function initially transverse the list giving it
n time to run. The comparison to test if the predicate is Big(O) to O(C), as there is no
list transversal or looping with the elements. The runtime of the test will be the same.
Therefore, the whole function remove_if then is O(n).
